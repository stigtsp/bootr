A javascript mechanism for loading javascript and css into localStorage. Compliments applicationCache for offline environments.

TODO:
- Remove jQuery dependency (use XHR instead)
- Support arbitrary number of files
- Avoid need to use json files (needed because js is evaled while downloading?)
- Docs/examples
